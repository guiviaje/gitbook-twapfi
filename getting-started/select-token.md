# ðŸª™ Select Token

There is an in-built token list for each network that is integrated onto the platform. If you search for a token and it doesn't show up on the token list, you will have to paste the token address on the search bar. The token you wish to trade will then be available for selection. Here's how:&#x20;

Let's assume you wish to trade $BRETT on Base.&#x20;

Step 1: Click on Buy / Sell Token button and type the name of the token. In this case, you would type 'brett" and notice that is not available for selection.&#x20;

Step 2: Navigate either to [dexscreener.com](https://dexscreener.com/) or [geckoterminal.com](https://www.geckoterminal.com/). We prefer DEX Screener.&#x20;

Step 3: Search for "brett" on DEX Screener and select a pair on the Base Network. In this case, we select BRETT/WETH on Base.&#x20;

Step 4: Once you are on the information page for BRETT/WETH, scroll down on the information column on the right hand side of the screen.&#x20;

Step 5: Copy the token address for BRETT only.&#x20;

Step 6: Paste this back on the twap.fi token search bar. You will find that $BRETT is now available to be traded on twap.fi.&#x20;

You will find that there is warning sign next to the token. This is to indicate this is a "non-trusted token" and you should double check the token address to ensure that you are trading the right token.&#x20;
