### What is a Swap?

Swaps are one of the most fundamental aspects of DeFi, involving the process of swapping the token you are willing to sell for the token you are looking to buy at the given market price. A DeFi swap is equivalent to a market order in which you wish to **buy or sell a token at its current market price.** Swap orders are **optimal when the primary goal is to execute the trade immediately.**&#x20;

A critical aspect to consider while executing swaps on DeFi is the slippage of the order. Slippage is the **difference between the expected price and executed price of the transaction.** Depending on the movement of the token price, traders can either benefit from slippage (**positive slippage**) or suffer from it (**negative slippage**). In order to minimise the impact of slippage on your transaction, you can limit the maximum slippage of your order to 1% or lower.&#x20;
