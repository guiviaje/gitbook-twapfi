# ðŸ’° Capital-Efficient DCA

### Key Information

### What is DCA?

Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which the buyer spreads out their purchases in equal instalments over a specified period of time. The primary aim of the DCA strategy is to mitigate the impact of market volatility by investing across different market conditions. Instead of committing a lump sum in a single transaction, DCA smooths out your overall costs, lowering your cost basis.&#x20;

Here is an example of how a DCA strategy might work. Letâ€™s assume a trader wishes to invest $1,000 in BTC. As the market fluctuates every day, the trader is unsure about the best entry price. By using the DCA strategy, the trader can invest $100 every day for the next 10 days to protect their investment from market volatility over the same time horizon.&#x20;

### Why our DCA?

Unlike many other protocols that transfer the total investment amount upfront at the time of transactions, Twap.fi takes a unique approach.
