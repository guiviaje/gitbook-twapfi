### Price protection

If the price drops below/above the limit price, **the TWAP will automatically pause transactions until the price returns above/below the limit price.** If enabled, the TWAP may not be fully completed within the designated duration.

**The limit price for price protection will be calculated as a percentage of the market price.** Let's assume the price of WETH/USDT is currently at $2300.\
\
If you are buying WETH with a price protection of 5%, your limit price will be above the current market price and will be set as $2415 (1.05\*2300). If you are selling WETH with a price protection of 10%, your limit price be below the current market price and will be set as $2070 (0.90\*2300). **The limit price will adapt itself based on the price protection percentage and the order direction.**&#x20;
