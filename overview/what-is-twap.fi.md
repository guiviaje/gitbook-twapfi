### Gas-less Transactions and Accessibility

One of Twap.fi's standout features is **gas-less transactions.** Gas fees, or the cost associated with processing transactions on blockchain networks, have been a significant barrier for many traders and users of DeFi platforms. Twap.fi addresses this issue by allowing users to execute transactions without incurring gas fees. Twap.fi **eliminates the need to purchase and hold the native token** for transaction approval, making trading more accessible and user-friendly.

### Empowering Novice Traders

Twap.fi doesn't just cater to seasoned traders; it also empowers novice traders by simplifying complex trading strategies. Novice traders can easily execute Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) orders, Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategies, and limit orders. These trading techniques are traditionally seen as advanced strategies, but Twap.fi makes them accessible to everyone.

### Integration with Major Aggregators

Twap.fi seamlessly integrates with **primary DEX aggregators**. Aggregators are tools that help traders find the best prices and liquidity across multiple decentralised exchanges. By integrating with these aggregators, Twap.fi acts as a meta-aggregator ensuring that traders can access the most favourable trading opportunities and execute their strategies efficiently.
